# SNAKE revisited

This project was just seeing what it's like to try and make a game engine, with a real game as the product.
This will be accomplished by creating a Platform Layer (really this layer will be SDL3, but we want to practice having
the seperation if we ever need to make something platform specific that SDL3 doesn't cover).
